### The LIGO Terms of Service
Updated: March 17, 2020.
Based on a fork of the GitHub Terms of Service, with thanks.


### A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what We mean when We use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the LIGO Privacy Statement, available at [ligolang.org/ADDURL](https://ligolang.org/ADDURL)) and procedures that We may publish from time to time on the Website.
2. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that You create or own.
3. “LIGO,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Ligo LANG SASU (128 rue de la Boetie, 75008, Paris), as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, employees and authorized contributors.
4. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by LIGO.
5. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service. A User must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction that they reside or access the Website or Services.
6. The “Website” refers to LIGO’s website located at [ligolang.org](https://ligolang.org/), and all content, services, and products provided by LIGO at or through the Website. It also refers to LIGO-owned subdomains of ligolang.org, such as [ide.ligolang.org](https://ide.ligolang.org/). Occasionally, websites owned or operated by LIGO may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

### B. Acceptable Use
**Short version:** *LIGO is collaborative project with users and contributors from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, You must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content You can post or input and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws applicable to LIGO's operations, or other laws in Your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that Your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that You will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://ADDURL).

### C. User-Generated Content
**Short version:** *You own content You create, but You allow Us certain rights to it, so that We can display and share the content You post. You still have control over Your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights You grant Us are limited to those We need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content if We need to.*

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that You input, post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of Your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. LIGO May Remove Content
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but We have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any LIGO terms or policies or is inconsistent with the LIGO community.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If You're inputting or posting anything You did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, You agree that You are responsible for any Content You input or post; that You will only submit Content that You have the right to use; and that You will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content You use through the Services.

Because You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, We need You to grant Us — and other LIGO Users — certain legal permissions, listed in this agreement and policies incorporated by reference. These license grants apply to Your Content. If You upload Content that already comes with a license granting LIGO the permissions We need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that You will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in this Agreement. The licenses You grant to Us will end when You remove Your Content from our servers, unless you have used the Services to deploy Your Content to a public blockchain or other Users have copied it.

#### 4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, deploy it and share it. You grant Us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, compile, deploy and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to You and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; deploy it to a public and immutable blockchain; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant LIGO the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Services.

#### 5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content You post publicly, including issues, comments, source code retained for the purpose of generating shared links and compiled source code deployed to the blockchain or other servers outside of LIGO's control, may be viewed by others. 

By sharing or deploying this User-Generated content publicly, You grant each User of LIGO and the LIGO Website and Services a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content and to reproduce Your Content. If You are uploading Content You did not create or own, You are responsible for ensuring that the Content You upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other LIGO Users.

#### 6. Contributions Under Repository License
Whenever You make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, You license Your contribution under the same terms, and You agree that You have the right to license Your contribution under those terms. If You have a separate agreement to license Your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

#### 7. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that You upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, You waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable Us to reasonably exercise the rights granted to Us in thie Agreement, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, You grant LIGO the rights We need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### D. Copyright Infringement
If You believe that content on our website violates Your copyright, please contact us. If You are a copyright owner and You believe that content published by LIGO or contained in the Website or Services violates Your rights, please contact Us by emailing contact@ligolang.org. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, You must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

### E. Intellectual Property Notice
**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for You to use our content, We give You certain rights to it, but You may only use our content in the way We have allowed.*

#### 1. LIGO's Rights to Content
LIGO and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to You under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © Ligo LANG SASU. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from LIGO.

Notwithstanding LIGO's ownership of the Content set out above, the LIGO project and source code are published under the MIT Open Source license. The project copyright and license terms can be found on the [Ligo Project Repository](https://gitlab.com/ligolang/ligo/-/blob/dev/LICENSE.md).

#### 2. Additional Copyrights, Terms of Use and Licenses May Apply

**Short version:** *We love open source, and these Terms of Service are not intended to limit or circumvent the open source licensing terms of the LIGO project, or any other projects. We also don't intend to step on any toes by asserting rights over other open source projects. Use other people's work at Your own risk, and in accordance with the terms they choose to publish under.*

Use of source code, applications and other software published by LIGO (see, for example, the [LIGO project repository](https://gitlab.com/ligolang/ligo)) or made accessible through the Website or Services may be subject to separate licencing, copyright and terms of use. Where there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and the terms of use or copyright published with respect to any specific LIGO source code, application or software, the specific terms will prevail. LIGO does not warrant or assert any ownership rights over third party source code, applications or software. 

#### 3. Feedback

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and Your feedback will help Us do that. If You choose to give Us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), You acknowledge and agree that LIGO will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, publish under open source license, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

### F. Additional Service Terms
**Short version:** *Some features of the Services require that You comply with additional terms and conditions specific to those Services. We are grouping these special terms and conditions here for convenience.*

Some Services may be subject to additional terms specific to a feature or product. By accessing or using the Services, You agree to be bound by the special terms and conditions set out below, and any other additional special terms and conditions brought to Your attention when using the Services.

#### 1. Restrictions on Content Deployed to Blockchain

**Short version:** *The Services include a compiler and related tools that can deploy data to a public blockchain. Don't include any personal information in the source code, compiled code or data deployed to the blockchain because this might violate privacy laws, including GDPR, as the information cannot be changed or removed once deployed.*

When using the LIGO compiler and tools found at [ide.ligolang.org](https://ide.ligolang.org/), data and source code compiled when using the *Deploy* command will be deployed to the Tezos test network blockchain. Once deployed, the compiled code and data is published to a publicly accessible ledger outside of LIGO's control and cannot be changed or deleted. As the deployed code and data cannot be changed or deleted, it must not contain any personal information or personally identifiable information.

### G. Disclaimer of Warranties
**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and We make no promises or guarantees about the Services. Please read this section carefully; You should understand what to expect.*

LIGO provides the Website and the Services “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, We expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

LIGO does not warrant that the Service will meet Your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from Your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service and Website.

### H. Limitation of Liability
**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from Your use or inability to use the Services or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to You.*

You understand and agree that We will not be liable to You or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

- the use, disclosure, or display of Your User-Generated Content;
- Your use or inability to use the Services;
- any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Services;
- the Website or Services generally or the software or systems that make the Services available;
- unauthorized access to or alterations of Your transmissions or data;
- statements or conduct of any third party on the Services;
- any other user interactions that You input or receive through Your use of the Services; or
- any other matter relating to the Services or Website.

Our liability is limited whether or not We have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay, even where the matters were within our reasonable control.

### I. Release and Indemnification
**Short version:** *You are responsible for Your use of the service. If You harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, We will not be involved.*

If You have a dispute with one or more Users, You agree to release LIGO from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold Us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of Your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to Your violation of this Agreement, provided that LIGO (1) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases LIGO of all liability); and (3) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.

### J. Changes to These Terms
**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — We don't want to bother You every time We fix a typo. So while We may modify this agreement at any time, We will provide users with notice of any material changes that affect their rights and give You time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. Minor changes may be made without notice, and We will notify You of material changes to this Agreement by posting a notice on our Website. Your continued use of the Website or Services constitutes agreement to Our revisions of these Terms of Service.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or Website (or any part of it) with or without notice. We will not be bound by any public statement or notice You make with respect to this Agreement unless We provide written confirmation of our agreement to be bound.

### K. Miscellaneous

#### 1. Non-Assignability
LIGO may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the [LIGO Privacy Policy](https://ADDURL), in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without Your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by You is void.

Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

#### 4. Amendments; Complete Agreement
This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of LIGO, or by the posting by LIGO of a revised version in accordance with [Section J. Changes to These Terms](#j-changes-to-these-terms). These Terms of Service, together with the LIGO Privacy Policy, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between You and Us.
