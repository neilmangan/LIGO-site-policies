### A. Data Collected on the Basis of Consent
Upon your implied or express consent, we collect a limited amount of data for the purpose of providing Services to you through the Website.

### B. Data Collected on the Basis of Legitimate Interest
Based on the legitimate requirements to operate the Services and Website, We collect the following data that may contain personal information or personally identifiable information.

#### 1. Third Party Message Transmission
Messages you may send to communicate with us are not sent through the Website or Services. Messages to use are sent by other channels and platforms and are subject to separate privacy policies and terms of service unique to those channels and platforms.

#### 2. Statistics
The Website uses Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States and allows us to observe and identify trends to improve the user experience on our website. Google Analytics processes data that may be considered personally identifiable, such as: the unique User ID set by Google Analytics, the date and time, the title of the page being viewed, the URL of the page being viewed, the URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page, the screen resolution, the time in local timezone, the files that were clicked on and downloaded, the links clicked on to an outside domain, the type of device, and the country, region, and city. LIGO does not use this information for advertising or re-marketing purposes.

#### 3. Code Stored for Sharing Links
The Website allows Users to input source code that can be compiled into output code using the Services. Where Users elect to create a unique link to share the source code the User inputs, a copy of this code is saved by LIGO so that it can be retrieved by any party with unique link generated by the Services. This source code is saved indefinitely to allow Users to share and return to the source code at a later time. If You include personal information or personally identifiable information in source code that is shared through the generation of a unique link, a copy of the enclosed personal information or personally identifiable information will be retained indefinitely by LIGO. By inputting source code into the Website and electing to generate a unique link to share the source code, you consent to the indefinite retention of the source code and disclosure of the source code to any person with the unique access link.

Compiled code deployed to the Tezos test network is accessible to the public and cannot be deleted or otherwise removed. The LIGO Terms of Service prohibit including personal information or personally identifiable information in source code deployed to the public blockchain through the Services. In the event that You deploy source code containing personally information or personally identifiable information, You irrevocably consent to the permanent disclosure of that information to the public and your behalf, and on behalf of every person whose personal information or personally identifiable information published through the deployment of Your source code.
